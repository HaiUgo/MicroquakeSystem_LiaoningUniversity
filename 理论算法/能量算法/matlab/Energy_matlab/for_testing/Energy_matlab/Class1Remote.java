/**
 * The <code>Class1Remote</code> class provides a Java RMI-compliant interface to MATLAB 
 * functions. The interface is compiled from the following files:
 * <pre>
 *  I:\\研究生阶段\\矿山\\理论算法\\能量算法\\matlab\\emd.m
 *  I:\\研究生阶段\\矿山\\理论算法\\能量算法\\matlab\\Energy.m
 * </pre>
 * The {@link #dispose} method <b>must</b> be called on a <code>Class1Remote</code> 
 * instance when it is no longer needed to ensure that native resources allocated by this 
 * class are properly freed, and the server-side proxy is unexported.  (Failure to call 
 * dispose may result in server-side threads not being properly shut down, which often 
 * appears as a hang.)  
 *
 * This interface is designed to be used together with 
 * <code>com.mathworks.toolbox.javabuilder.remoting.RemoteProxy</code> to automatically 
 * generate RMI server proxy objects for instances of Energy_matlab.Class1.

     * Provides the standard interface for calling the <code>emd</code> MATLAB function

     * Input arguments to standard interface methods may be passed as sub-classes of

     * supported Java type (i.e. scalars and multidimensional arrays of any numeric, 
     * boolean, or character type, or String). Arguments passed as Java types are 
     * converted to MATLAB arrays according to default conversion rules.
     *
     * All inputs to this method must implement either Serializable (pass-by-value) or 
     * Remote (pass-by-reference) as per the RMI specification.

     * returned as sub-classes of <code>com.mathworks.toolbox.javabuilder.MWArray</code>. 
     * Each output array should be freed by calling its <code>dispose()</code> method.
     *
     * @throws java.rmi.RemoteException An error has occurred during the function call or 
     * in communication with the server.
